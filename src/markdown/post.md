**There are thousands of posts on the internet dedicated to this topic. I'll try to avoid the clich√© advice (unless it is REALLY true), which is usually stuff like "learn how to write clean code". Sure, it's a sign of a good developer, but not only is it a pretty vague statement, it is also something that can only come with time and practise. This article's aim is to give some concrete tips that you can apply to your job right now.**

## Learn how to ask questions
- Give context.
- Ask for suggestions, not for them to do it.
- Separate domain knowledge from technical knowledge.
## 30-minute rule

Now you've learnt how to ask questions, you need to know when to ask them when working on a problem. A common stressor for junior developers is not wanting to bombard seniors with question. The 30-minute rule is a good rule of thumb for when you need to ask for help on a problem. <br/><br/>
"If after 30 minutes you've made 0 progress, ask for help."
<br/><br/>
If you ask before this time, you haven't given yourself enough opportunity to tackle the problem yourself, and you are wasting someone else's time.
If you don't ask after this time, then you are wasting your own time.
<br/><br/>
bear in mind this is not the amount of time spent on the problem in total but rather the amount of time spent with 0 progress. So you may have been progressing well for a few hours on a ticket before starting the 30-minute timer in your head. Don't get too hung up on the number 30, experiment with the time and see what works best for you and your team.
## Setup Your Environment
## Separate technical and domain knowledge
